VAE, GAN and WGAN models for the MNIST dataset.

To train the VAE model you can just run main_vae.py . Number of epochs can be changed , 1 epoch takes about 10 seconds on my computer. After the model finish running for the given number of epochs plot of the loss functions is shown.

For the GAN model I implemented 2 functions called train and Wasserstein_train. There are 2 lines at the bottom of the main_gan.py . You can choose one of them and comment out the other and run main_gan.py to train. 1 epoch takes about 40 seconds for Wasserstein GAN (due to gradient penalty calculation) and about 20 seconds for normal GAN on my computer. After the model finish running for the given number of epochs plot of the loss functions is shown.

For generation, you can scroll to the bottom of both generator_vae.py and generator_gan.py and you will see some example codes commented out. You can uncomment them and run the code. Pickle files should be in the same folder as the python files. After you run the code for generation there will be a matplotlib plot consisting of 100 images. Code for calculation of the FID and KID scores are also in these files. Example codes to calculate the metrics is also commented out. Installing torch-fidelity is necessary to be able to calculate KID, FID scores.
