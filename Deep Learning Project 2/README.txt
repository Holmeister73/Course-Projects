3 layer CNN for CIFAR10 dataset. With data augmentation and dropout it can reach %89 test accuracy. Written in pytorch.

To train the model running the main.py is enough. At the end of each epoch test accuracy and training loss is printed to the console. Plot of loss is shown when training is done. 

To evaluate and visualize(tsne) a network, eval.py can be used. At the end of eval.py file there are some commented out example codes to evaluate and visualize.
